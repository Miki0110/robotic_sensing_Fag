This is a mini-project for the robotic perception subject.

The project tries to implement a detection software that can classify a series of object. In this case the category of objects is Instruments where in four classes have been defined, Acoustic Guitar, electric bass, trumpet and a drumm set.
This mini-project is very simple and therefore each object is displayed on a white background, making image processing simple.


There are two executable python files in this project
1. instrument_data.py
2. insrument_detector.py

The data file is used to generate data from various training images, while the instrument detector is the actual detection program. 

To test with your own images simple put .jpg files into the "materialer" folder and assign them a number, the amount of pictures tested can then be changed in the instrument_detector file
